# Electrocity-Consumption-Anomaly-Detection

UC Berkeley Data-X Fall 2018 project

Over-consumption of electrical energy has been a
growing concern worldwide. Electricity over-consumption
incurs not only economical issues but also severe
environmental concerns, such as light pollution and
increased carbon emissions. Therefore, the objective of
this project is to predict energy consumption and identify
anomalous consumption through the means of training
energy usage dataset with Auto ARIMA, SARIMA
and RNN machine learning
models.
